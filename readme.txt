üêù BeeBrained‚Äôs MAT (Master Automation Tool) üêù
A versatile automation tool designed for efficiency and flexibility, perfect for repetitive tasks in games like Pet Simulator 99 (PS99) and beyond. Available in two flavors: a feature-rich Python version with GUI and OpenCV template matching, and a lightweight AutoHotkey (AHK) version focused on simplicity and coordinate clicking.

Features
Python Version (BMAT.py)
- Configurable Settings: Loads from BeeConfig.ini with validation and defaults.
- Hotkeys & GUI: Control via hotkeys (Enter, Esc, P, C, Shift+C, WASD) and a 400x400 GUI with matching buttons.
- Window Cycling: Finds and switches between target windows (e.g., Roblox), with customizable exclusions.
- Coordinate Clicking: Capture and click positions with randomization for natural behavior.
- Template Matching: Uses OpenCV to detect and interact with on-screen images (e.g., buttons, items).
- Anti-AFK Movement: Simulates WASD key presses to keep sessions active.
- Robust Error Handling: Retries failed actions and ensures clean shutdowns.

AHK Version (BMAT.ahk)
- Configurable Settings: Loads from BeeConfig.ini with basic validation and defaults.
- Hotkeys: Control via Enter (start), Esc (stop), P (pause/resume), and C (capture coords).
- Window Cycling: Detects and switches between Roblox windows, with customizable exclusions.
- Coordinate Clicking: Capture and click positions with randomized timing.
- Lightweight: No external dependencies‚Äîjust AutoHotkey.
- Limitations: No GUI (uses ToolTips/MsgBoxes), no template matching, no WASD movement.

Installation
Python Version (BMAT.py)
- Prerequisites:
  - Python 3.8+
  - Install libraries: `pip install pyautogui keyboard pywin32 opencv-python numpy`
- Download:
  - Clone or download ZIP: `git clone https://github.com/xXGeminiXx/BeesPS99MasterAutomation.git`
- Run:
  - Navigate to folder and execute: `python BMAT.py`
  - BeeConfig.ini auto-generates if missing.

AHK Version (BMAT.ahk)
- Prerequisites:
  - AutoHotkey v1.1+ (https://www.autohotkey.com/)
- Download:
  - Clone or download ZIP: `git clone https://github.com/xXGeminiXx/BeesPS99MasterAutomation.git`
- Run:
  - Double-click BMAT.ahk or run via: `"C:\Program Files\AutoHotkey\AutoHotkey.exe" BMAT.ahk`
  - BeeConfig.ini auto-generates if missing.

Usage
Python Version (BMAT.py)
- Launch: Run to open the GUI.
- Capture Targets:
  - Coords: Press C or click ‚ÄúCapture Coords‚Äù to record positions.
  - Templates: Press Shift+C or click ‚ÄúCapture Templates‚Äù to select ROIs (ESC to cancel).
- Control:
  - Start: Press Enter or click ‚ÄúStart‚Äù.
  - Pause/Resume: Press P or click ‚ÄúPause/Resume‚Äù.
  - Stop: Press Esc or click ‚ÄúStop‚Äù.
  - Move: Use W, A, S, D or buttons (when running, not paused).
- Monitor: GUI shows state (Idle/Running/Paused), coord count, and template count.

AHK Version (BMAT.ahk)
- Launch: Run to initialize (tray tip confirms readiness).
- Capture Targets:
  - Coords: Press C to record positions (ToolTip feedback).
- Control:
  - Start: Press Enter.
  - Pause/Resume: Press P.
  - Stop: Press Esc (or tray icon).
- Monitor: ToolTips show state and actions.

Configuration
Both versions use BeeConfig.ini. Key options:
- click_delay_min/max: Timing range for clicks (seconds).
- timer_interval: Seconds between window cycles.
- excluded_titles: Window titles to skip (comma-separated).
- Python-only: match_threshold (0.0-1.0 for template matching).
Edit BeeConfig.ini to customize, or let the script generate defaults.

How It Works
Python Version (BMAT.py)
- Config Loading: Validates BeeConfig.ini, creates defaults.
- Hotkeys: Binds Enter, Esc, P, C, Shift+C, WASD; stop always active.
- GUI: 400x400 window, updates every 100ms with status and buttons.
- Loop: Finds Roblox windows, clicks coords, matches templates, waits between cycles.
- Templates: OpenCV screenshots and matches with retry logic.
- Clicking: Randomized for human-like input.
- Movement: WASD presses (0.5s each) when running.
- Threading: Daemon thread for clean shutdown.

AHK Version (BMAT.ahk)
- Config Loading: Loads BeeConfig.ini with basic checks.
- Hotkeys: Binds Enter, Esc, P, C; stop always active.
- Loop: Timer-driven, finds Roblox windows, clicks coords, waits between cycles.
- Clicking: Randomized timing and offsets.
- No GUI/Templates: Uses ToolTips, lacks OpenCV features.

Technical Details
Python Version
- Config: Comprehensive with min/max validation.
- Hotkeys: Respect paused state (except stop).
- GUI: Real-time updates, button-hotkey parity.
- Loop: Robust window management and safety checks.
- Templates: Reliable OpenCV matching.
- Threading: Efficient daemon thread.

AHK Version
- Config: Basic INI with defaults.
- Hotkeys: Debounced, native AHK system.
- Loop: Timer-based with window stability checks.
- Clicking: Randomized for natural behavior.
- No Dependencies: Pure AHK.
